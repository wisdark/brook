## Run brook wssserver

Make sure your domain name has been resolved successfully. Brook will automatically issue a certificate for your server, assuming your domain is `domain.com`. If there is a firewall, remember to allow TCP on this port 80 and 443.

```
$ brook wssserver --domain domain.com --password hello
```

> More parameters: \$ brook wssserver -h

Then your brook wssserver should be: `wss://domain.com:443`

## Run it in the background via `nohup`

```
$ nohup brook wssserver --domain domain.com --password hello &
